#Team Setup Instructions

1. Install Required Software

Git
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Python 3.x (IMPORTANT: check “Add Python to PATH”)
https://www.python.org/downloads/

VS Code (recommended)
https://code.visualstudio.com/

Restart your terminal after installation.




2️. Clone the Repository

Open Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux):

git clone https://github.com/Vros15/ai-study-productivity-assistant.git
cd ai-study-productivity-assistant

3️. Switch to the Development Branch
git checkout dev


Confirm:
git branch

You should see:

* dev
  main




4️. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv


Activate it:

Windows (Git Bash):

source venv/Scripts/activate

Mac/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

You should see (venv) in the terminal.




5️. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt




6️. Create .env File (DO NOT COMMIT)

Create a file named .env in the project root:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Never commit .env to GitHub
It is already included in .gitignore.




7️. Run the Application
python run.py

Open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000


If you see:

AI Study & Productivity Assistant is running!

Setup is complete.




#Git Workflow Rules

To avoid conflicts and broken code, follow these rules strictly:

Never commit directly to main

Never commit directly to dev

Always work in a feature branch

Merge changes into dev using a Pull Request





#Creating a Feature Branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature-your-feature-name
Examples:

feature-auth
feature-ai-service
feature-dashboard




#Pushing Your Work
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
git push origin feature-your-feature-name

Then open a Pull Request → dev on GitHub.

Testing & Development Notes

Always pull latest dev before starting work

Commit small, logical changes

Use clear commit messages

If something breaks, ask before pushing





#Contribution Expectations

All team members are expected to:

Follow the Git workflow

Test their code before pushing

Document major changes

Communicate blockers early




#License

This project is developed for academic purposes as part of a UMGC capstone course.
